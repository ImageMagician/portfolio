		<h1>Mark Larson UI Portfolio</h1>
		<p>
			These are hi-fi prototypes for a software project currently under development. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, the images should not be copied, distributed or otherwise used other than for display on this site.
		</p>
		<h2>Software Screens</h2>
		<p>
			<img src="_images/IP_Landing_CE_Chart_Tile.png" alt="" /><br />
			Landing page for all interviews done for the client. The goal was to give them quick understanding of the outcome of the deals for which they were interviewed as well
			as an overall view of the company's sales efforts.
		</p>
		<div class="hz"></div>
		<p>
			<img src="_images/IP_Profile_CE_Defector_Slideout_KPI.png" alt="" /><br />
			One view of an individual deal profile. The slideout area is mostly for quantitiatve information while the main panel contains the interview content
		</p>
		<div class="hz"></div>
		<p>
			<img src="_images/HZ_Research_Tile.png" alt="" /><br />
			This is the main landing page for a client's research program. The owner requires a lot of detail to be available for this screen. This caused quite a challenge
			to display his desired information while making the interface intuitive for the user.
		</p>
		<div class="hz"></div>
		<p>
			<img src="_images/HZ_Interview-Tool_Loop_Ranking.png" alt="" /><br />
			This is the tool interviewers use to organize their questions and input data into the system while speaking with the respondent. Again, the owner demands a lot 
			of information to be available on screen. This proved to be challenging when trying to design for a potential lowest screen resolution of 1024x768
		</p>
		<div class="hz"></div>
		<p>
			<img src="_images/HZ_Profile-Editor_View_Recording.png" alt="" /><br />
			This module is used to edit an interview's responses and prepare it for publication.
		</p>
		<div class="hz"></div>
		<p>
			<img src="_images/HZ_Overview-Editor_Action-Item.png" alt="" /><br />
			This module is used to allow an analyst to build a report based on the respondent's feedback
		</p>
		<div class="hz"></div>
		<p>
			<img src="_images/HZ_Stakeholders_Add.png" alt="" /><br />
			This screen is used to add "stakedholers" to a program. These are people who need to insert their directions to the Program Consultant to get the information
			that will satisfy their research needs.
